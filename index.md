## Welcome to Programming Lab A

This is the course website for Programming Lab A at [International College of Technology, Kanazawa](https://www.ict-kanazawa.ac.jp/) (ICT). 

In this course, we will study programming in Python with various lessons and a capstone project. The assignments will use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) as a kind of interactive worksheet with programming exercises. There are a few options for how to set up your computer for Jupyter Notebooks. See [Getting Started](#getting-started) below for details.

#### Why Python?

Python is one of the world's most popular programming languages because it has:
- Simple and efficient syntax (grammar) that is easy to learn and use.
- Large variety of stable libraries available for things like developing desktop apps or games, processing big data and creating visualization, and building websites.

### Getting Started

There are a couple options for setting up your environment with Python. You can install all your tools **piece-by-piece**, or you can install an **all-in-one** virtual environment that has everything you need inside it.

#### Piece-by-Piece

With this method, you will need to install Python, a text editor, and Jupyter separately. 

#### All-in-One

With this method, you can simply install Anaconda. Anaconda is a virtual environment application with an intuitive interface for managing your tools and software configurations. With Anaconda, you can easily run VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, or a terminal with all the necessary configurations.
